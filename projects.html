				<h2><a href="https://github.com/bledoux2002/botbowl"><b>Bot Bowl Agent Evolution</b></a></h1>
				<p>Paper can be found <a href="misc/botbowl.pdf">here</a>. Abstract: We discuss the methods by which we evolved a rules-based expert system for a competitive agent to submit to the Bot Bowl competition using Genetic Algorithms (GAs). The expert system is evolved by identifying variables that can be refined through the GA, and measuring the success of each variation by its performance against a baseline opponent. A variation is derived from a string of bits, or “chromosome,” that defines the rule set used by the agent. One of the unique challenges of using a GA in the Bot Bowl environment is the low-scoring nature of the game. Rather than using the score as the only measurement of success for the fitness calculation, we propose including the ball’s progression towards the opposing end zone to quantify the performance of a particular chromosome.</p>

				<h2><a href="https://github.com/bledoux2002/Music-Box"><b>Music Box</b></a></h1>
				<p>An open source music downloader and player. Original intended for TTRPG usage as a more seamless way to play ambient music, it also serves well as a normal music player. You can download single videos or entire playlists from youtube with a single link thanks to <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt_dlp</a>. Playback comes with modern functionality such as keyboard shortcuts for seeking through a track, volume control, switching playlists, and deleting tracks. Playlists can be renamed and shuffled. All settings are saved into a json file that is loaded on launch. The UI is made with TKinter. Future work will focus around feature implementation and compatibility with more operating systems. Created as a personal project for use within my TTRPG group.</p>

				<h2><a href="https://github.com/bledoux2002/Unity-Procedural-Generation-Framework"><b>Procedural Tilemap Generator</b></a></h1>
				<p>Designed as a framework, the goal of this project is to allow for Unity developers to procedurally generate their game worlds with relative ease. The developer first provides a set of tiles and creates "TileData" objects for each one. These TileDatas allow for developers to assign rules to each tile, dictating which tiles can be placed next to each other, and the frequency of generating each tile. Multi-tile sprites are handled by allowing for "required tiles" in the TileDatas, forcing the necessary tiles to be generated in the appropriate relative locations to each other. After the TileData rules are defined, the tool generates in real-time. As unassigned tiles on the map come within a developer-defined range of the main camera, a list of valid tiles is created using the intersect of valid tiles adjacent to surrounding tiles (the valid tiles South of the tile immediately North, etc.). The map is saved to a JSON file so that tiles generated during runtime aren't lost. Current work involves eliminating "clamping" errors where a tile cannot generate because it is surrounded by tiles that have no connecting tiles. This is accomplished by simulating several layers around the empty tile so that once a valid generation is found, a tile is selected that is guaranteed to not cause clamping. Future work will focus on adding more features and demonstrating the tool's capabilities in an open-world game. Upon completion this tool will be placed on the Unity Asset store as a free package. Created as a Senior-Year Integrative Project (SIP) for AT491/492: Independent Study under the Ammerman Center using Unity 2D.</p>

				<h2><a href="https://github.com/bledoux2002/Unity-Procedural-Tile-Generation"><b>Procedural Tilemap Generator</b></a></h1>
				<p>Designed to be used as a general-use tool, the goal of this project is to allow for Unity developers to 
					procedurally generate their game worlds with relative ease. The developer first provides a set of tiles and creates 
					"TileData" objects for each one. These TileDatas allow for developers to assign rules to each tile, dictating which 
					tiles can be placed next to each other, and the frequency of generating each tile. Multi-tile sprites are handled by 
					allowing for "required tiles" in the TileDatas, forcing the necessary tiles to be generated in the appropriate relative 
					locations to each other. After the TileData rules are defined, the tool generates in real-time. As unassigned tiles on 
					the map come within a developer-defined range of the main camera, a list of valid tiles is created using the intersect 
					of valid tiles adjacent to surrounding tiles (the valid tiles South of the tile immediately North, etc.). The map is 
					saved to a JSON file so that tiles generated during runtime aren't lost. Current work involves eliminating "clamping" 
					errors where a tile can be surrounded by tiles that have an empty intersect of compatible adjacent tiles sets. This 
					is accomplished by simulating several layers around the empty tile so that once a valid generation is found, a tile 
					is selected that is guaranteed to not cause any clamping errors. Future work will focus on adding more features and 
					demonstrating the tool's capabilities in an open-world game. Upon completion this tool will be placed on the Unity 
					Asset store as a free package. Created as a Senior-Year Integrative Project (SIP) for AT491/492: Independent Study 
					under the Ammerman Center using Unity 2D.</p>

				<h2><a id="title" href="https://github.com/bledoux2002/Diegetic-Direction"><b>Diegetic Direction</b></a></h1>
				<p id="desc">A study into different methods of guiding users in a virtual environment. Focusing on subtle diegetic 
					methods, the goal is to determine how efficient each of these methods are across a range of subjects for a single 
					general purpose. The methods include using landmarks, light, paths, and terrain as means of attracting a player's 
					attention. There are 5 "scenes," each aimed at testing a particular method, except for the control scene. Participants 
					in the study complete the control test first, then the rest of the 4 remaining test in a randomized order. Participants 
					are timed overall and for how long they used the sprint functionality. During tests, breaks between scenes are used to 
					conduct quick interviews. Afterwards, screen recordings, data logs, and test notes are gathered together for comparison 
					and analysis. Current work involves a preliminary round of testing to ensure the tests are completable and reasonable 
					in scope. Future work will focus on refining tests if necessary, and then conducting a full set of tests will a large 
					pool of volunteers. Created as research for COM495/496: Research Seminar using Unity 3D.</p>

				<p id="desc">Currently a terminal-based program, the advantages of having a system by which to create characters quickly for 
					a pen-and-paper/TTRPG game master are irrefutable. This program will automate the process by taking user input and applying 
					necessary changes. If a particular core attribute is upgraded, the associated stats will update accordingly; if a character 
					levels up, a list of perks filtered by requirements will be presented to choose from; choosing an equipment package at 
					creation automatically places the associated items in the character's inventory. As of now, the main functionality is 
					creating and managing the character files themselves, and editting simple aspects like name, level, core attributes, etc. 
					Future work will focus on completing basic editting capabilites, adding automation, and completing the data file with the 
					necessary perks and equipment. The final goal with this project is to distribute it as an executable to the relevant 
					pen-and-paper/TTRPG communities. Upon completion, a website integration is being heavily considered. Created as a personal

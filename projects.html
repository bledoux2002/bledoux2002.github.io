	<img src="./images/SIP.jpeg" alt="Procedural Tilemap Generation as 2D Open-World RPG">
	<p id="desc">Designed to be used as a general-use tool, the goal of this project is to allow for Unity developers to procedurally generate their game worlds with relative ease. The developer first provides a set of tiles and creates "TileData" objects for each one. These TileDatas allow for developers to assign rules to each tile, dictating which tiles can be placed next to each other, and the frequency of generating each tile. Multi-tile sprites are handled by allowing for "required tiles" in the TileDatas, forcing the necessary tiles to be generated in the appropriate relative locations to each other. After the TileData rules are defined, the tool generates in real-time. As unassigned tiles on the map come within a developer-defined range of the main camera, a list of valid tiles is created using the intersect of valid tiles adjacent to surrounding tiles (the valid tiles South of the tile immediately North, etc.). The map is saved to a JSON file so that tiles generated during runtime aren't lost. Current work is focused on avoiding "clamping" errors where a tile can be surrounded by tiles that have an empty intersect of compatible adjacent tiles sets. This is accomplished by simulating several layers around the empty tile so that once a valid generation is found, a tile is selected that is guaranteed to not cause any clamping errors. Created as a Senior-Year Integrative Project (SIP) for AT491/492: Independent Study under the Ammerman Center.</p>

	<img src="./images/research_small.jpg" alt="Research Project Main Menu in Unity Real-Time Development Platform">
	<p id="desc">A study into different methods of guiding users in a virtual environment. Focusing on subtle diegetic methods, the goal is to determine how efficient each of these methods are across a range of subjects for a single general purpose. The methods include using landmarks, light, paths, and terrain as means of attracting a player's attention. There are 5 "scenes," each aimed at testing a particular method, except for the control scene. Participants in the study complete the control test first, then the rest of the 4 remaining test in a randomized order. Participants are timed overall and for how long they used the sprint functionality. During tests, breaks between scenes are used to conduct quick interviews. Afterwards, screen recordings, data logs, and test notes are gathered together for comparison and analysis. Created as research for COM495/496: Research Seminar.</p>

	<p id="desc">Currently a terminal-based program, the advantages of having a system by which to create characters quickly for a pen-and-paper/TTRPG game master are irrefutable. This program will automate the process by taking user input and applying necessary changes. If a particular core attribute is upgraded, the associated stats will update accordingly; if a character levels up, a list of perks filtered by requirements will be presented to choose from; choosing an equipment package at creation automatically places the associated items in the character's inventory. As of now, the main functionality is creating and managing the character files themselves, and editting simple aspects like name, level, core attributes, etc. Future work consists of completing basic editting capabilites, adding automation, and completing the data file with the necessary perks and equipment. The final goal with this project is to distribute it as an executable to the relevant pen-and-paper/TTRPG communities. After completion, a website integration is being heavily considered. Created as a personal project.</p>

	<img src="./images/humphreys.jpeg" alt="Connecticut College campus bar, Humphrey's, in Unity">
	<p id="desc">The Connecticut College campus bar, Humphrey's, recreated in virtual reality using the Oculus Integration for Unity. The environment is used as a testing grounds for comparing and contrasting interaciton and locomotion with controllers and hand-tracking. Different features of the VR Bar include an ID scanner, a station to pour (and spill) a drink, and a functional pool table. Overall the benefits of using controllers far outweighed the immersion of using hand-tracking for interaction. Controllers are more consistent and easier for the headset to keep track of, while hand-tracking was jittery and unreliable. Completed as a final project for COM309: Graphics and Virtual Environments.</p>

	<img src="./images/aimlab.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of AimLabs recreated in Unity">
	<p id="desc">A recreation of 3 gamemodes in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/714010/Aimlabs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AimLabs</a>, a popular aim-training game for FPS games. The goal was to set up testing scenarios in which to collect data relating to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fitt's Law</a> when applied in virtual reality. The first of the three modes recreated is Spidershot, in which an orb teleports on destruction to a random location alternating with the center of the test area. The second mode recreated is Gridshot, in which the orb will teleport to one randomized location in a predetermined 5x5 grid directly in front of the player upon being destroyed. The final mode recreated is Strafetrack, in which the orb will move side-to-side, randomly switching directions, and teleporting to a random location along that axis upon destruction. Completed as a midterm project for COM309: Graphics and Virtual Environments.</p>

	<img src="./images/starbeat.jpeg" alt="Mid-game screenshot showing stars progress towards middle">
	<p id="desc">2D space-themed rhythm game designed for touch screens. Specifically, this game was designed to make use of the <a href="https://www.conncoll.edu/information-services/instructional-technology/technologies-for-teaching-and-learning/visualization-wall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visualization Wall</a> in the basement of Shain Library, a collection of panels and lasers that come together to form an 8' by 4' touch screen. The core gameplay loop consists of tapping the stars as they cross the glowing ring on their way towards the centerpiece. The closer the center of the star is to the ring, the higher the point gain. Completed as a final project for COM217: Entertainment Software Design.</p>

<!-- Bio -->
<div style="width:55%;float:left">
<h2 style="text-align:center">Overview</h2>
<p>&emsp;I am a senior undergraduate student at Connecticut College majoring in Computer Science. As a member of the Ammerman Center for Arts and Technology, I have shaped my studies around the intersection between art and tech. Specifically, I am studying the design and development of video games and other interactive media.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">Educational Work</h2>
<p>&emsp;My current studies include researching different diegetic methods of guiding users in virtual environments, developing an open-source tool for the Unity engine that procedurally generates tilemaps, and creating environments in virtual reality. You can read more about my current and past work on the <a href="./projects.html">Projects</a> page. Since the beginning of my Junior year, I have worked as a teacher's assistant in the Computer Science department at Conn, grading homeworks, conducting labs, and holding group study sessions for students to get help on homework, projects, and concepts discussed during class. As of Fall 2023 I am now the Communications Manager for the CS Student Advisory Board at Conn. On top of general SAB duties like helping to plan and prepare for events, along with providing new and useful resources to students, I also manage our social media accounts, emails, and design posters for events.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">Personal Projects</h2>
<p>&emsp;As for personal projects, I am currently developing a terminal-based character creation and management program for the tabletop roleplaying game <a href="https://www.modiphius.net/en-us/pages/fallout-the-roleplaying-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallout 2d20</a> by Modiphius Entertainment, a Quake-style FPS in a post-apocalyptic setting, and an independent port of the card game "<a href="https://fallout.wiki/wiki/Caravan_(game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caravan</a>" from <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. The latter two projects are being developed on the Unity Engine. In-depth descriptions of all of my current and previous projects, along with links to their GitHub repositories, can be found on the <a href="./projects.html">Projects</a> page.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">Fun Facts</h2>
<p>&emsp;In my free time I enjoy volleyball, soccer, snowboarding, photography, playing different pen-and-paper/tabletop roleplaying games, including Dungeons and Dragons and Fallout 2d20, and, of course, playing and developing video games.</p>

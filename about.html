<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="./images/pfp_square.jpg" alt="Headshot" style="width:25%">

<p>&emsp;I am a senior undergradute student at Connecticut College, majoring in Computer Science. As a member of the Ammerman Center for Arts and Technology, I have shaped my studies around the intersection between art and tech. Specifically I am studying the design and development of video games and other interactive media.</p>
<p>&emsp;My current studies include researching different methods of guiding users in virtual environments, developing an open-source tool for the Unity engine that procderually generates tilemaps, and developing environments in virtual reality.</p>
<p>&emsp;As for personal projects, I am currently developing a Quake-style game in a post-apocalyptic setting, and an independent port of the card game "<a href="https://fallout.wiki/wiki/Caravan_(game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caravan</a>" from <em>Fallout: New Vegas<em>. Both projects are being developed on the Unity Engine.</p>
